    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    C8:8C:02:5E:2C:9C:36:C8:B0:D4:86:1B:7C:CC:84:5F:A8:35:57:E6

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    C8:8C:02:5E:2C:9C:36:C8:B0:D4:86:1B:7C:CC:84:5F:A8:35:57:E6

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
